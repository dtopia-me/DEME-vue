            <h4>What is Flip?</h4>
            <p>Flip is a board style platform made of 10K frames that are controllable by NFTs.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Are Flip NFTs digital collectibles?
            </h4>
            <p>
                No. Flip NFTs differ from digital collectibles by allowing holders to change the contents that are associated with the tokens and providing more functionalities around the tokens.
            </p>
            <h4>
                What can a user do with a Flip NFT?
            </h4>
            <p>
                A NFT holder can first upload and update the contents on a frame or a flipboard that this NFT is associated with. A holder can also merge adjacent two frames that are mergeable at a time. A large frame can also be split into two smaller frames suitable to the holderâ€™s needs. Two token holders can also swap NFTs either in a shallow way or a deep way. Last but not the least, a NFT holder can transfer the token to another address by only paying gas fees and can always list the NFT on a platform-native marketplace by setting up an ask price.
            </p>
            <h4>
                What is a frame and what is a flipboard? Is it the same with a normal million pixel webpage?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Flip project got the inspiration from Million Pixel Webpage, and moved way beyond it. A frame starts from a unit of 10 by 10 pixels and can grow much bigger. It also allows users to change photos or pictures inside it, just like a frame does. Besides, another cool feature this project has is more room for exhibition in flipboards is provided. A flipboard is a hyper position with additional pages for more in-depth introduction to the photo in the front. Having a frame and flipboards combined, a token holder can provide the community a much more in-depth introduction to whatever message he intends to deliver. And of course, a separate webpage with more details like prices, traction histories, etc., for the NFT token is available.

            <h4>
                Which blockchain is this project built on?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The smart contracts are deployed on Binance Smart Chain for low gas fees and high TPS. We would like to provide the best possible experiences for the users.
            </p>
            <h4>
                How many NFTs are there in total?
            </h4>
            <p>
                In the first phase, only one board with 10K NFTs are available. In the following phases, boards targeting specific markets like China, South Korea and Europe with corresponding themes will be opened. The good part is all boards share the same token set.
            </p>
            <h4>
                What is the FLP token-economics?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The total supply is 15 million FLP tokens. The number is capped even when more boards are coming along.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Who are the team members behind Flip?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Flip has been brought to you by Epimorphism Foundation.
